# Hypothesis
1. Visual cue  
a) Does the visual cue made difference? Also, could we observe neural spike rise due to some kind of expectation?
2. Functional laterization  
a) Does subjects had inclined laterization if they have dominant ear?  
b) If so, does the direction of visual que/stimulus matters?  
3. Frequency spectrum  
a) Does frequency spectrum of one's hearing ability decides familiarity on particular speaker?  
b) Could short-term familiarity on particular speaker could be built after this training?
4. Guess Detection  
a) Sometimes the response may be done with guessing/elimination. We may detect this with neural/ocular records or by (experimentally) applying mTRF on recordings.
